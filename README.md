# Rules as Code Guide

This guide came to be as part of the [Cardano Rules as Code Project](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/402385) for the team working togehter to report and build a guide for helping other teams build their own Rules as Code projects. 

This will grow over the term of the project and is intended to share resources and multiple types of "chapters", tutorials, blog posts and other content that helps others learn about the process of developing Rules as Code systems and their potential benefits.
